# The signs of a real polynomial near a point and near infinity

Candidates for `Mathlib.Analysis.Polynomial.Basic`: a nonzero real polynomial has, far right, the
sign of its leading coefficient and, far left, that sign times `(-1) ^ deg`
(`Polynomial.eventually_atTop_sign_eval`, `Polynomial.eventually_atBot_sign_eval`), so that the sign
variations of a list of nonzero polynomials there are those of their leading coefficients
(`Polynomial.eventually_atTop_signVariations`, `Polynomial.eventually_atBot_signVariations`); near a
point it keeps a nonzero sign (`Polynomial.eventually_sign_eval_eq`), and just right of a point `x`
where it or its derivative does not vanish it has the sign of `p(x)`, or of `p'(x)` when `p(x) = 0`,
and just left of `x` that of `p(x)`, or of `-p'(x)` when `p(x) = 0`
(`Polynomial.eventually_sign_eval_nhdsGT`, `Polynomial.eventually_sign_eval_nhdsLT`). By the
intermediate value theorem, opposite signs at two points give a root between them
(`Polynomial.exists_isRoot_of_eval_mul_eval_neg`), a negative sign just right of the left end of an
interval without a root holds on the whole interval (`Polynomial.eval_neg_of_forall_not_isRoot`),
and a nonzero polynomial of degree `n` changes its sign at most `n` times along increasing points
(`Polynomial.length_le_natDegree_add_one_of_isChain`).

## Implementation notes

The signs just right and just left of a point are stated by the case distinction on `p(x) = 0`,
without a definition of their own: Mathlib after the version that the project pins defines the sign
just right of a point as a limit for every `p` (`Polynomial.signRight`, pull request #44248), which
the project can take over at its next update of Mathlib.
