# The sign variations of positive multiples and of polynomials near infinity

Candidates for a file of Mathlib on Sturm's theorem: lists of polynomials over an ordered field that
are entrywise positive multiples (`Polynomial.PosAssoc`), such as a generalized Sturm sequence and
the Sturm sequence of its first two entries, have the same sign variations at every point and at
`±∞` (`Polynomial.signVariations_map_eval_eq_of_forall₂`,
`Polynomial.signVariations_map_leadingCoeff_eq_of_forall₂`,
`Polynomial.signVariations_map_neg_one_pow_mul_leadingCoeff_eq_of_forall₂`); and far right, the sign
variations of a list of nonzero polynomials at a point are those of their leading coefficients, and
far left those of their leading coefficients, each times `(-1) ^ deg`
(`Polynomial.eventually_atTop_signVariations`, `Polynomial.eventually_atBot_signVariations`).

## Implementation notes

The file has no Mathlib sibling: Mathlib has the Sturm sequence
(`Mathlib.Algebra.Polynomial.Sturm.Sequence`) and the sign variations of a list
(`Mathlib.Data.List.SignVariations`), but neither file imports the other, and Mathlib has neither
Sturm's theorem nor a file that imports both. So the file chooses its imports: the sign
variations, and the mirrors of the Sturm sequence (`Polynomial.PosAssoc`) and of the eventual signs
of polynomials (`Mathlib.Analysis.Polynomial.Order`, which brings the filters and the ordered
normed fields of the statements).
