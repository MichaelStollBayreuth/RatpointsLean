# Lemmas on lists

Candidates for Mathlib's lemmas on lists, about the notions of core: filtering a list before
`List.flatMap f` changes nothing when every element `x` with `f x ≠ []` passes the filter, the
counterpart of `Finset.prod_filter_of_ne`, next to `List.flatMap_congr`, and so a list without
duplicates within another one without duplicates that holds every `x` with `f x ≠ []` gives a
permutation of its `List.flatMap f`; and a filter by a test that holds on all elements of a list
or on none keeps all of it or nothing.

## Main statements

* `List.flatMap_filter_of_ne`: a filter before `List.flatMap` that changes nothing.
* `List.perm_flatMap_of_nodup`: the `List.flatMap` of a list without duplicates of members of a
  list `l` without duplicates, in any order, that holds every member with a nonempty image, is a
  permutation of that of `l`.
* `List.filter_eq_ite_of_forall`: a filter that keeps all of a list or nothing.
