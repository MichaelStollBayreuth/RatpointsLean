# Permutations from the maps of lists without duplicates

Candidates for `Mathlib.Data.List.Nodup`, next to `List.Nodup.map_on` and `List.nodup_flatMap`: a
list without duplicates, mapped by a function that is injective on it, is a permutation of every
list without duplicates whose members are the images; and a concatenation `l.flatMap f` has no
duplicates when the member of `l` that gives an entry can be read off the entry.

## Main statements

* `List.perm_map_of_nodup`: the map of a list without duplicates by a function injective on it is
  a permutation of every list without duplicates with the same members.
* `List.Nodup.flatMap`: `l.flatMap f` has no duplicates when `l` and each `f a` have none and `a`
  is a function of each entry of `f a`.
