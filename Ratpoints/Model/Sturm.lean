# The Sturm step

The Sturm step of ratpoints, `_ratpoints_compute_sturm` of `sturm.c`, which restricts the search to
the intervals where the polynomial `f` may be `≥ 0`, computed in integers and on the doubles of the
C code as `sturm.c` computes it. First the remainder chain of `f` and its derivative `f'`, row by
row and with its loops (`Ratpoints.Sturm.chain`): a remainder is zero exactly when `f` has a
repeated factor; the chain is `none` then, and ratpoints refuses the form as not squarefree, as
`Ratpoints.findPoints` does with the Sturm step on. Then the numbers of sign changes of the chain at
`-∞` and `+∞` from the leading coefficients (`Ratpoints.Sturm.countsAtInfinity`), with the exit
when `f` has no real root and is negative; the bisection of the real line from `[-∞, +∞]`, which
drops an interval without a root on which `f` is negative, keeps one without a root on which it is
positive and one at the depth of the step, and splits the others at their midpoint
(`Ratpoints.Sturm.midpoint`), where it evaluates the chain (`Ratpoints.Sturm.evalSign`,
`Ratpoints.Sturm.signsAt`), the left half first (`Ratpoints.Sturm.iterate`); the kept intervals,
with dyadic ends `n / 2 ^ e` converted to doubles and an interval that begins where the last one
ends joined to it (`Ratpoints.Sturm.addInterval`); and their intersection with the search intervals
of the caller (`Ratpoints.Sturm.intersect`). The whole step is `Ratpoints.Sturm.computeSturm`,
which the search calls through `Ratpoints.sturmRegion`.

## Main definitions

* `Ratpoints.Sturm.reduce`: one reduction of a remainder by the row before it, which cancels its
  leading coefficient.
* `Ratpoints.Sturm.chain`: the remainder chain of `f` and `f'`, or `none` when a remainder is zero.
* `Ratpoints.Sturm.evalSign`, `Ratpoints.Sturm.signsAt`: the sign of a row at a dyadic number, and
  the signs of `f` and `f'` and the number of sign changes of the chain there.
* `Ratpoints.Sturm.countsAtInfinity`: the numbers of sign changes of the chain at `±∞`.
* `Ratpoints.Sturm.midpoint`, `Ratpoints.Sturm.addInterval`, `Ratpoints.Sturm.iterate`: the
  bisection.
* `Ratpoints.Sturm.meet`, `Ratpoints.Sturm.intersect`: the intersection with the caller's
  intervals.
* `Ratpoints.Sturm.computeSturm`: the Sturm step.

namespace Sturm

/-- One reduction of `t` by `s`, for `deg t ≥ deg s`, each given by the array of its coefficients up
to its degree, constant term first: `u t - v X^(deg t - deg s) s`, where `u` and `v` are the leading
coefficients of `s` and `t` divided by their positive gcd and signed so that `u > 0`; the leading
coefficient of the result is `0`. -/
def reduce (s t : Array Int) : Array Int :=
  let d1 := s.size - 1
  let d2 := t.size - 1
  let g : Int := Int.gcd s.back! t.back!
  let u0 := s.back! / g
  let v0 := t.back! / g
  let u := if u0 < 0 then -u0 else u0
  let v := if u0 < 0 then -v0 else v0
  (Array.range (d2 + 1)).map fun n ↦
    if n < d2 - d1 then u * t[n]! else u * t[n]! - v * s[n - (d2 - d1)]!

/-- The remainder chain of the polynomial `f` of degree `d ≥ 1` with the coefficients
`c₀, …, c_d`, the entries of `c`, and `c_d ≠ 0`, in rows of integers: `s₀ = f`, `s₁ = f'`, and for
`k = 2, …, d` the row `s_k` from the remainder `t` of `s_(k-2)` by `s_(k-1)`. Starting from
`t = s_(k-2)`, while the degree of `t` is at least that of `s_(k-1)`, `t` is reduced by `s_(k-1)`
(`Ratpoints.Sturm.reduce`) and its zero leading coefficients are dropped; the chain is `none` when
`t` becomes zero, which happens exactly when `f` has a repeated factor
(`Ratpoints.Sturm.run_chain_eq_none_iff`). Otherwise `s_k` is `-t` divided by the gcd of its
coefficients, whose loop stops when the gcd is `1`, and the chain ends when `s_k` is constant. Each
row is the array of its coefficients up to its degree, constant term first; for `d = 1` the loop
over `k` does not run, and the chain is `f, f'`.

C: `sturm.c:99-163`

Deviation: the rows as arrays of their coefficients up to their degree, for the table of `(d + 1)^2`
GMP integers and the array of degrees, with no `mpz_init` and `mpz_clear` (a chain has at most
`d + 1` rows, `Ratpoints.Sturm.IsChain.size_le`, and its row `k + 1` at most `d - k` entries,
`Ratpoints.Sturm.IsChain.size_getElem!_add_one_add_le`): an array has one entry more than the degree
of its row, and a remainder that becomes zero is the empty array, where the degree in the C code
reaches `-1`; a reduction step drops the leading coefficient, which it makes `0`, where the C code
lowers the degree; the rows are handed back, and `none` for the return of `-1`, where
`_ratpoints_compute_sturm` keeps them in its table for the rest of the Sturm step
(`Ratpoints.Sturm.computeSturm`), and the index of the last row, which the C code leaves in `k` and
sets to `d` after the loop for `d = 1`, is the size of the array less one; a list of integers for
the array of GMP integers of the coefficients, local values for the scratch integers `work[0]`,
`work[1]` and `work[2]`, and Lean's `/` for `mpz_fdiv_q`, which agree on the divisions of the chain,
all exact. -/

/-- The sign `-1`, `0` or `1` of the value at `num / 2 ^ denexp` of the polynomial whose
coefficients, constant term first, are the entries of `row`, as `eval_sign` computes it: by Horner's
rule in integers, from the leading coefficient `w = c_deg`, for `n = deg - 1, …, 0` in turn
`w = w num + c_n 2 ^ e` with `e = denexp, 2 denexp, …`, so that `w` is `2 ^ (deg denexp)` times the
value, `deg` the size of `row` less one.

C: `sturm.c:67-84`

Deviation: the row as an array of integers, for the GMP integers `cofs` and the `long` `degree`,
which is the size of the array less one; integers for the GMP integers `work[0]` and `work[1]`, the
multiplication by a power of 2 for `mpz_mul_2exp`, and `Int.sign` for `mpz_sgn`; `Int64` for the
`long`s `num`, `denexp` and `e`; the steps counted up from `0` to `deg - 1`, for the index `n` that
counts down; no scratch integers of the arguments. -/
def evalSign (row : Array Int) (num denexp : Int64) : Id Int := do
  let deg := row.size - 1
  let mut w := row[deg]!
  let mut e := denexp
  for i in [0:deg] do
    w := w * num.toInt + row[deg - 1 - i]! * 2 ^ e.toInt.toNat
    e := e + denexp
  return w.sign

/-- The numbers of sign changes of the rows `0, …, k` of the chain `rows` at `+∞` and at `-∞`, the
pair `(count1, count2)`, from the signs of their leading coefficients: two neighbouring rows count
at `+∞` when their leading coefficients have different signs, and at `-∞` when they do after the
sign of each row of odd degree is flipped.

C: `sturm.c:165-175`

Deviation: natural numbers for the `long` counts, which stay at most `k`; the rows as arrays, their
degrees the sizes less one, for the arrays `sturm` and `sturm_degs`, and `Int.sign` for `mpz_sgn`;
the counts returned, for the locals of `_ratpoints_compute_sturm`. -/
def countsAtInfinity (rows : Array (Array Int)) (k : Nat) : Id (Nat × Nat) := do
  let mut count1 := 0
  let mut count2 := 0
  for n in [0:k] do
    let d1 := rows[n]!.size - 1

    if d2 % 2 = 1 then s2 := -s2
    if s1 ≠ s2 then count2 := count2 + 1
  return (count1, count2)

/-- `LONG_MAX = 2 ^ 63 - 1`, as `_ratpoints_compute_sturm` computes it, the `unsigned long` `-1`
shifted right by one bit: the numerator of the end at `+∞` of the bisection, and its negation that
of the end at `-∞`; converted to doubles, they become `±2 ^ 63`, beyond every `x = a / b` with
`|a| ≤ LONG_MAX`.

C: `sturm.c:191-192`

Deviation: one constant for the two locals `max` and `min = -max`. -/
def longMax : Int64 := ((~~~0 : UInt64) >>> 1).toInt64

/-- The point `nm / 2 ^ dem` at which the bisection splits the interval from `nl / 2 ^ del` to
`nr / 2 ^ der`: `0` for `[-∞, +∞]`; for `[-∞, nr]` the point `-1` if `nr = 0` and else `2 nr`, and
for `[nl, +∞]` the point `1` if `nl = 0` and else `2 nl`, both with `dem = 0` (the ends at infinity
are `∓Ratpoints.Sturm.longMax`, with the exponent `0`); for finite ends with `del = der`, which are
then both `0`, the half of `nl + nr`, with `dem = 0` when the sum is even and `dem = 1` otherwise;
and else the sum of the ends over the larger denominator, divided by `2`, so with the larger
exponent plus `1`.

C: `sturm.c:234-251`

Deviation: the point returned as a pair, for the locals `nm` and `dem` of `iterate`; `Int64` for
the `long`s, `>>>` on `Int64` the arithmetic shift of the C code; the arithmetic of `Int64`
wrapping where that of the `long`s overflows, which it does not up to the depth `55` at which the
search clamps the step, where every finite end is `n / 2 ^ e` with `|n| ≤ 2 ^ 53`. -/
def midpoint (nl nr del der : Int64) : Int64 × Int64 :=
  if nl == -longMax then
    if nr == longMax then (0, 0) else (if nr == 0 then -1 else 2 * nr, 0)

  else if der < del then (nl + nr * (1 <<< (del - der)), del + 1)
  else (nl * (1 <<< (der - del)) + nr, der + 1)

/-- The signs `s0` and `s1` of `f` and `f'` at `nm / 2 ^ dem` (`Ratpoints.Sturm.evalSign`) and the
number `cmid` of sign changes of the rows `0, …, k` of the chain `rows` there, zeros skipped: the
first two rows count when their signs are opposite; then the sign `s` of the last row that is not
zero, `s0` when `s1 = 0`, and each further row counts when its sign is `-s`, and replaces `s` when
it is not zero.

C: `sturm.c:252-260`

Deviation: a function of its own for the evaluation of the chain at the midpoint in `iterate`, the
signs and the count returned, for its locals `s0`, `s1` and `cmid`; integers for the `long` signs
and a natural number for the `long` count; the rows as arrays, for the arrays `sturm` and
`sturm_degs`. -/
def signsAt (rows : Array (Array Int)) (k : Nat) (nm dem : Int64) : Id (Int × Int × Nat) := do
  let s0 ← evalSign rows[0]! nm dem
  let s1 ← evalSign rows[1]! nm dem
  let mut cmid := if s0 * s1 = -1 then 1 else 0

      cmid := cmid + 1
      s := s2
    else if s2 ≠ 0 then s := s2
  return (s0, s1, cmid)

/-- The interval from `nl / 2 ^ del` to `nr / 2 ^ der` added to the intervals `iv` that the
bisection keeps: its ends converted to doubles, `ldexp((double)n, -e)` (`Ratpoints.Double.ofInt64`,
`Ratpoints.Double.ldexp`), which is exact up to the depth `55` and gives `±2 ^ 63` for the ends at
infinity; the interval appended, or, when the last interval kept ends at its lower end (`==` of the
doubles, `Ratpoints.Double.beq`), that interval extended to its upper end.

C: `sturm.c:209-227`

Deviation: a function of its own for the branch of `iterate` that keeps an interval; the intervals
kept as an array, passed and returned, for the array `ivlocal` on the stack and the pointer `iptr`
of `_ratpoints_compute_sturm`, which `iterate` reaches as a nested function of gcc, with no bound
`1 + ⌊degree / 2⌋` on their number, the size of `ivlocal`, which the C code relies on; the doubles
as their bits (`Ratpoints.Double`); `Int64` for the `long`s, converted to integers for the `int`
casts of the exponents. -/
def addInterval (iv : Array (Double × Double)) (nl nr del der : Int64) : Array (Double × Double) :=
  let l := (Double.ofInt64 nl).ldexp (-del.toInt)
  let u := (Double.ofInt64 nr).ldexp (-der.toInt)
  match iv.back? with
  | some (lo, up) => if up.beq l then iv.pop.push (lo, u) else iv.push (l, u)
  | none => iv.push (l, u)

/-- The bisection of `_ratpoints_compute_sturm`, the nested function `iterate`, on the interval from
`nl / 2 ^ del` to `nr / 2 ^ der`, an end at infinity `∓Ratpoints.Sturm.longMax` with the exponent
`0`, with the numbers `cleft` and `cright` of sign changes of the chain `rows` (index of the last
row `k`) at its ends, as the step hands them on, and the signs `sl` and `sr` of `f` just inside its
ends, at the depth `depth`, adding the intervals it keeps to `iv`: an interval with `cleft = cright`
and `sl < 0`, without a root of `f` and with `f < 0` on it, is dropped; one with `cleft = cright`
and `sl > 0`, or at the depth `iter`, is kept (`Ratpoints.Sturm.addInterval`); and any other is
split at its midpoint `m` (`Ratpoints.Sturm.midpoint`), where the chain is evaluated
(`Ratpoints.Sturm.signsAt`), and its left half bisected before its right half, the count at `m` and
the sign of `f` at `m` handed to both halves, and when `m` is a root of `f`, the count plus `1` and
`-f'(m)` to the left half and the sign of `f'(m)` to the right half, the count and the sign just
left and just right of the simple root `m`.

C: `sturm.c:197-208`, `sturm.c:228-233`, `sturm.c:261-267`

Deviation: a recursive function of its own, for the nested function of gcc, with the intervals kept
passed and returned (`Ratpoints.Sturm.addInterval`), for the array `ivlocal` and the pointer `iptr`
that it reaches, and the chain, the index of its last row and the depth of the step as arguments,
for the arrays `sturm` and `sturm_degs`, `k` and `iter` that it reaches; natural numbers for the
`long` counts, depths and the `long` `iter`, which is from `0` to `55` (the search clamps it,
`find_points.c:4682`), integers for the `long` signs, and `Int64` for the other `long`s; the
recursion ends since the depth grows towards `iter`. -/
def iterate (rows : Array (Array Int)) (k iter : Nat) (nl nr del der : Int64) (cleft cright : Nat)

/-- One step of the intersection of the interval `a` that the bisection keeps with the interval `b`
of the caller, both closed, as the loop of `_ratpoints_compute_sturm` makes it: the interval it
notes, if any, and whether it goes on with the next interval kept (`true`) or the next interval of
the caller (`false`), the one that ends first. If `a` begins first (`a.low ≤ b.low`): `a` is
forgotten if it ends before `b` begins, and otherwise `[b.low, a.up]` is noted with the next `a` if
`a.up ≤ b.up`, and `b` with the next `b` otherwise; symmetrically if `b` begins first. The ends are
compared as doubles (`Ratpoints.Double.le`, `Ratpoints.Double.lt`) and copied, so that a `-0.0` of
the caller can stay.

C: `sturm.c:289-322`

Deviation: a function of its own for the body of the loop, the interval noted and the cursor to
move returned, for the write into `ivlist[n]` and the increments of `n`, `n1` and `n2`. -/
def meet (a b : Double × Double) : Option (Double × Double) × Bool :=

    if b.2.lt a.1 then (none, false)
    else if b.2.le a.2 then (some (a.1, b.2), false)
    else (some a, true)

/-- The intersection of the intervals `loc` that the bisection keeps with the intervals `ivs` of the
caller, both increasing and disjoint, by the loop of `_ratpoints_compute_sturm`: from the first of
each, while both lists have one left, a step (`Ratpoints.Sturm.meet`) notes their intersection, if
they meet, and goes on with the next interval of the list whose interval ends first. The noted
intervals may be degenerate, `[a, a]`.

C: `sturm.c:276`, `sturm.c:285-288`, `sturm.c:323`, `sturm.c:325`

Deviation: the intervals of the caller read from the array it gives, where the C code reads them
from a copy on the heap (lines 274-275, 286) and writes the intersection over them; the
intersection returned as a new array, for the writes into `ivlist` and the number `num_inter` of the
arguments that it sets; natural numbers for the `long` indices. -/

    if first then n1 := n1 + 1 else n2 := n2 + 1
  return out

/-- The Sturm step `_ratpoints_compute_sturm` on the polynomial `f` of degree `d ≥ 1` with the
coefficients `c₀, …, c_d`, the entries of `c`, and `c_d ≠ 0`, to the depth `iter`, for the search
intervals `ivlist` of the caller, increasing and disjoint: none when the remainder chain is none
(`Ratpoints.Sturm.chain`), for a polynomial with a repeated factor; the empty array when the chain
has as many sign changes at `-∞` as at `+∞` (`Ratpoints.Sturm.countsAtInfinity`), so that `f` has no
real root, and `c₀ < 0`, so that `f < 0` everywhere; and otherwise the intervals that the bisection
keeps from `[-∞, +∞]` (`Ratpoints.Sturm.iterate`, with the counts at `∓∞` at its ends and the sign
of `c_d`, negated at `-∞` for odd `d`, as the signs just inside them) intersected with `ivlist`
(`Ratpoints.Sturm.intersect`), which is empty when they do not meet.

C: `sturm.c:86-97`, `sturm.c:177-190`, `sturm.c:193-194`, `sturm.c:269-273`, `sturm.c:326-332`

Deviation: the coefficients, the degree, the depth and the search intervals as arguments, for the
fields `cof`, `degree`, `sturm`, `domain` and `num_inter` of the arguments; natural numbers for the
`long`s `degree` and `iter`, which is from `0` to `55` (the search clamps it,
`find_points.c:4682`); the result as an option of an array, for the `long` that the C code returns
and the intervals it writes into `domain` with their number `num_inter`: none for `-1`, the empty
array for `0`, with `num_inter = 0`, and else the intervals, their number the return value; the
table of the chain made by `Ratpoints.Sturm.chain`, whose rows the step reads, for the table on the
stack with the degrees, which `_ratpoints_compute_sturm` fills itself, the index of the last row
the size of the chain less one, for the `k` of line 163; the array of the intervals kept made by
`Ratpoints.Sturm.iterate`, for the array `ivlocal` on the stack of `1 + ⌊degree / 2⌋` intervals;
integers for the GMP integers and `Int.sign` for `mpz_sgn`; no `mpz_init` and `mpz_clear`, no copy
of the caller's intervals on the heap and no failure for lack of memory (`RATPOINTS_NO_MEMORY`),
which the model cannot meet. -/
