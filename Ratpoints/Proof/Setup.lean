# The set-up of a search: the polynomial of a coefficient list, the remainder chain, the reversal

The C code works with the polynomial `f = ∑ cᵢ Xⁱ` of the coefficient list `c` and its degree `d`,
the refusals speak about the binary form `Φ_c` of degree `N = 2 ⌈n / 2⌉`
(`Ratpoints.binaryFormPoly`), where `n + 1` is the length of `c`. `Φ_c` is the homogenization of `f`
of degree `N`, so it is squarefree exactly when `f` is squarefree and `N ≤ d + 1`: the two
conditions that the C code tests, the second when it drops the leading zeros, the first with the
remainder chain of its Sturm step. The rows of the chain, as polynomials over `ℚ`, form a
generalized Sturm sequence, positive rational multiples of the entries of Mathlib's
`Polynomial.sturmSeq`, along which the coprimality of `f` and `f'` passes down to the last two rows,
so that the chain detects a repeated factor of `f`. In each of its three cases the reversal check
replaces `c` by its reflection in the even degree `D = d + d % 2` of the binary form, which
exchanges `x` and `z` in the binary form and so does not change whether it is squarefree, and its
refusal, of `c₀ = c₁ = 0` for even `d`, stands for `X ^ 2 ∣ Φ_c`; so once the test of the leading
zeros has passed, the remainder chain of the polynomial that the check hands on detects exactly the
forms that are not squarefree. The map of the points of the reversed curve to those of the caller's
curve (`Ratpoints.Sieve.swapPoint`) is a bijection between the points of height at most `H`.

## Main definitions

* `Ratpoints.poly`: the polynomial `f = ∑ cᵢ Xⁱ` over `ℚ` of a coefficient list `c`.

## Main statements

* `Ratpoints.getD_degree_ne_zero_of_pos`, `Ratpoints.natDegree_poly`: the entry of `c` at a
  positive degree is not zero, and the degree of `f` is `Ratpoints.degree c`.
* `Ratpoints.poly_take_of_degree_lt`: the entries of `c` above its degree do not change `f`.
* `Ratpoints.binaryFormPoly_eq_homogenize`: `Φ_c` is the homogenization of `f` of degree `N`.
* `Ratpoints.squarefree_binaryFormPoly_iff`: `Φ_c` is squarefree if and only if `f` is squarefree
  and `N ≤ d + 1`.
* `Ratpoints.not_squarefree_binaryFormPoly_of_lt`,
  `Ratpoints.not_squarefree_binaryFormPoly_of_getD_zero`: a drop of `⌈n / 2⌉` by the leading
  zeros, and `c₀ = c₁ = 0`, leave a form that is not squarefree.
* `Ratpoints.Sturm.IsChain.exists_mul_eq`, `Ratpoints.Sturm.IsChain.natDegree_lt`: three
  consecutive rows `s_k`, `s_(k+1)`, `s_(k+2)` of a remainder chain satisfy
  `A s_k = Q s_(k+1) - g s_(k+2)` with integers `A, g > 0`, and the degrees decrease from `f'` on.
* `Ratpoints.Sturm.run_chain_eq_none_iff`: for `d ≥ 1` and `c_d ≠ 0`, the remainder chain of the
  model is `none` exactly when the polynomial of `c₀, …, c_d` is not squarefree.
* `Ratpoints.Setup.getD_eq_of_reversal_eq_ok`, `Ratpoints.Setup.binaryForm_eq_of_reversal_eq_ok`:
  the list that the reversal check reverses `c` to is the reflection of `c` in the degree `D`, and
  its binary form is that of `c` with `x` and `z` exchanged.
* `Ratpoints.Setup.degree_eq_of_reversal_eq_ok`, `Ratpoints.Setup.eq_of_reversal_eq_ok_false`: the
  degree that the check returns is that of the list it returns, and without a reversal these are
  `c` and its degree.
* `Ratpoints.Setup.one_le_of_reversal_eq_ok`: the check keeps the degree at least `1`.
* `Ratpoints.Setup.squarefree_binaryFormPoly_iff_of_reversal_eq_ok`: once the test of the leading
  zeros has passed, `Φ_c` is squarefree exactly when the polynomial that the check hands on is.
* `Ratpoints.Setup.exists_reversal_eq_error_iff`,
  `Ratpoints.Setup.not_squarefree_binaryFormPoly_of_reversal_eq_error`: the check refuses exactly
  the even degrees with `c₀ = c₁ = 0` when its switch lets it run, and only forms that are not
  squarefree.
* `Ratpoints.Sturm.run_chain_eq_none_iff_of_reversal_eq_ok`: once the test of the leading zeros has
  passed, the remainder chain of the polynomial that the check hands on is none exactly when `Φ_c`
  is not squarefree.
* `Ratpoints.Sieve.isPoint_swapPoint`, `Ratpoints.Sieve.perm_map_swapPoint_bruteForce`: the map of
  a reversed search sends the points of the reversed curve to points of the caller's curve, and the
  brute-force reference of the one, mapped, is a permutation of that of the other.

/-- The polynomial `f = ∑ cᵢ Xⁱ` over `ℚ` with the coefficient list `c`, constant term first, which
the C code works with; `Ratpoints.binaryFormPoly c` is its homogenization of degree `2 ⌈n / 2⌉`,

`Polynomial.ofFn` builds the same polynomial from a vector `Fin n → R`; the sum here has the shape
of `Ratpoints.binaryFormPoly`, so that `Ratpoints.binaryFormPoly_eq_homogenize` holds term by
