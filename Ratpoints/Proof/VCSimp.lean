# The simplification of the verification conditions

The contracts of the components with a loop are proved by `vcgen`, whose verification conditions
encode the weakest preconditions in the order of `Prop`: meets, propositions of the order, the
measures that end the loops and the applied invariants of the `while` loops. The tactic `vc_simp`
rewrites these encodings into plain propositions in all the hypotheses and the goal, with further
lemmas of each contract (the invariants to unfold and propositional clean-up), before the dispatch
of the conditions.

## Implementation notes

The file uses Lean core and `Std` only, as the contracts that use the tactic do.
