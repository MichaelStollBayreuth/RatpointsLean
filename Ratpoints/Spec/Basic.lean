# The specification

The points that ratpoints finds, for a coefficient list `c` (constant term first) and a height
bound `H`: the binary form `F` of `c` and the normalized points `(x, y, z)` of height at most `H`
on `y ^ 2 = F(x, z)`; and the binary form over `ℚ` that the refusals of the program speak about.
The specification uses Mathlib and nothing of the model, so that it can be read on its own; the
comparator challenge restates `Ratpoints.degree`, `Ratpoints.binaryForm`, `Ratpoints.IsPoint` and
`Ratpoints.binaryFormPoly` verbatim.

## Main definitions

* `Ratpoints.degree`: the degree of the polynomial with coefficient list `c`.
* `Ratpoints.binaryForm`: the binary form `F(x, z)` of even degree that the program evaluates.
* `Ratpoints.binaryFormPoly`: the binary form over `ℚ` of degree `2 ⌈n / 2⌉`, where `n + 1` is the
  length of `c`, whose squarefreeness decides the refusals.
* `Ratpoints.IsPoint`: `(x, y, z)` is a normalized point of height at most `H`.
* `Ratpoints.points`: the finite set of these points.

## Main statements

* `Ratpoints.eval_binaryFormPoly`: on every input that the program does not refuse, the two
  forms agree.
* `Ratpoints.finite_setOf_isPoint`, `Ratpoints.mem_points`: the points form a finite set.

## Implementation notes

The coefficients are written `c.getD i 0`: Mathlib's notation `c[...]` for cycles makes `c[i]`
fail for a list named `c` wherever all of Mathlib is imported.

The file imports `Mathlib.Algebra.Squarefree.Basic`, which its definitions do not need, for the
refusal theorems, which say that `Ratpoints.binaryFormPoly c` is not `Squarefree`: the comparator
challenge imports, besides the model, which uses no Mathlib, exactly the public imports of this
file, so that the definitions that it restates elaborate to the same terms as here.
